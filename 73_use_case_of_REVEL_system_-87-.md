+ wall or surface with graphic image of an object projected on it; Revel
system allows user to feel the object, manipulate it; kinect tracks users
finger, computer alternates the current to change the tactile sensation
accordingly.

  

"With REVEL technology it is relatively easy to provide tactile

feedback to almost any interactive surface, whether dedicated or

ad-hoc, including solid structures such as beams, walls, floors and

ceilings. In our exemplary implementation \(Figure 13\) a part of

the laboratory drywall was painted with conductive paint coated

with a thin layer of white varnish, creating a smooth white projection

surface \(Figure 7d\). Conductive floor tiles were directly connected

to earth ground. A REVEL device was embedded in the

shoe worn by the user, where the tactile signal was injected into

the user’s foot, while the bottom of the shoe’s heel provided a link

to the ground \(Figures 7 and 13\). When the user’s finger slides on

the wall the user can perceive tactile sensations."
