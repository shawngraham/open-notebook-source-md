+ if schiller  (neuroscientist ) is right about how memories are formed & rewritten  ("memory reconsolidation" ) cf
[[49_bibx-_repairing_bad_memories_-63-.md]]

+ and we can reprogram the emotional content of those memories  (see pstd research, as in <http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/brain-circuit-links-emotion- memory-0827> and here, false memories <http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2013/neuroscientists-plant-false-memories-in-the-brain-0725>  )

+ then aural AR could reprogram emotional/historical engagement with sense-of-place?

hmmm.
