-author describes his piece, 'Anita ind Clarence in der Holle \(<-umalut on o\): An Opera for Split-Brains in Modular Parts

-plays anita hill, clarence thomas sexual harassment testimony at his senate hearings. Since they sit in almost exactly the same seat, video angle, the author can play their testimony simultaneously, using a system that feeds each video to a single eye, at the same time

-article mostly discusses the visual phenomena that ensue \(including a quasi 3d effect\)

-"With the simultaneous playback of the opening statements by Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas, the listener literally hears two voices at the same time... \[an effect that\] can be likened to musical polyphony... as each word is spoken, it overlaps or alternates in an antiphonal manner with the words of the other speaker... at other moments spoken words changing in pitch, rhythm, tempo and intonation are delivered in a singsong manner, not unlike the operative device of recitative. Sometimes the simultaneous testimony is more like a duet. There are contrapuntal effects resulting from the repetition of words and phrases, sometimes shifted in time or changed in word order."
