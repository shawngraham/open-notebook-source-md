+ memories appear not to be filed away, but rather re-written anew each time we recall them; the act of recollection re-writes the memory.

Shiller: "my conclusion...is that memory is what you are now. Not in pictures, not in recorddings. Your memory is who you are now".

-author: "to put it in an extreme way, if we are all rewriting our memories every time we recall an event, the memory exists not as a file in our brain but only as the most recent rewrite of a scenario. every memoir is fabricated, and the past is nothing more than our last retelling of it. archival memory data is mixed with whatever new information helps shape the way we think - and feel - about it."
