Abstract:
What do games teach? What do games represent? What can games _do_ ? Nothing, except interpret the rules of the game. In that mindlessness lies their power for our research and outreach. In this contribution, I outline some of the theoretical dimensions of (in particular) video game studies and consider their intersection with archaeological theory and practice. While one might most naturally expect games and public archaeology to be a natural fit, I will suggest there are deeper connections with culture and how we understand it.
