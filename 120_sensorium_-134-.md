b/c there is constant interaction b/w sense & physical world, agency of
objects is in their ability to bring forth and to direct people's responses.
Key passage:

  

p165

"We all live in a sensorium which is socially and culturally created; which
depends on subtle interactions between people and things. An object with new
or subversive sensory qualities will send social relations off down a new
path, both through any intention on the part of the object, but through its
effects on the sets of social relations attached to various forms of sensory
activity."
