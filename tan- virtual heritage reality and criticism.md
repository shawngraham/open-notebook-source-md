title: Tan - "Virtual heritage Reality and criticism"
]]


"To virtualize heritage means to actualize the heritage content digitally and to simulate it using computer graphics technology."  + that's the thing right there, that word 'actualize'. Need to unpack that. p144

> "According to Addison (2000) there are three major domains in virtual heritage:
  - 3D Documentation: everything from site survey to epigraphy 
  - 3D Representation: from historic reconstruction to visualization
  - 3D Dissemination: from immersive networked worlds to ‘in-situ’ augmented reality." - p 146   
[Page 5](sk://tan_virtual_2009#5)

p 146 - Tan identifies a series of short-comings. under the header 'lack of meaningful and cultural content' he writes 
> "Some authors have blamed today’s virtual worlds as static and lifeless (Addison 2000). Other authors have identified other weakness such as lack of engagement, lack of realism, lack of meaningful content, confusing interface design, orientation and navigation difficulties and a paucity of useful feedback mechanism (Champion 2002; Costalli et al. 2001; Economou and Tost 2008). Even when photorealistic architecture reconstructions are found to be very impressive, they lack dynamic elements such as virtual humans or animals (Yang et al. 2006), rain, wind and fog in most cases."

Tan notes that there is never one finished point in terms of the life of a structure - then notes 
>'However, the process of virtual reconstruction (Figure 1) expresses the truth of rigidness and one-way data flow. Documentation stage is always concerned about ‘authentication’ of data; representation stage is aimed at ‘accuracy’, while dissemination stage focuses on showing its ‘mastery of technology’.' p147

- Tan notes another problem - the lack of engagement. The user has either a fps type interface, or a guided tour, watching or being moved around the digital landscape. They are designed with 'a minimum opportunity of active participation from users. Even if the viewing control is given to the user, rarely is there a role for visitor [sic] to play or to perform any action or task that is not predefined'. p147

"Lidunn Mosaker (2001) surveyed visitors with two virtual heritage projects made by ‘Hellenic Worlds’ and ‘Nu.M.E. (Nuovo Museo Elettronico)’ and observed that most of the users do not know about the details of the ancient architecture styles and are not fascinated by the environment. His findings showed that visitors are more interested in the human part of the city life, which is something they can actually relate to but not with the built forms. Perfectly designed virtual buildings, columns, details and cornices do not mean anything to them; they only gave a ‘sterile impression’ to visitors." p148 under 'Lack of sense of place'. These places 'lack richness of association and affordances'

pg 148 - 'Also virtual environments typically have less annotation ability with the exception of 2nd Life and Forbidden City. They are mostly built for single-user and can only allow seeing others; sharing information is limited to chat, send -pg149- ing files or hyperlinks. Some recent VE allows users to buy and sell goods or gamble but are mostly very limited for other different social interactions."

pg 149 under 'technological limitation', subheading 'technical artistry and power of new technology', 'According to Champion (2004), the notion of photo- realism often suggests an authoritative knowledge of the culture that the authors or designers in fact may not possess.'

 pg 150, under 'lacking positive attitude of wide dissemination, distribution and use', (which I think means something like, 'People don't trust digital simulacra') 
 >'Fiona Cameron (2008) has brought up the present debates on the meaning and relationship between historical collections and digital ‘historical’ objects in the light of material- culture paradigm and object-centeredness of museum culture. According to Cameron, ‘digital objects’ are always being judged from the standpoint of the ‘superior’ physical counterpart. Physical object carries the essence of aura, evidence, the passage of time, the signs of the power through accumulation, authority, knowledge, and privilege. Digital media on the other hand, is considered as immediate, surface, temporary, modern, popular and democratic (Witcomb 2008). So mass dissemination of virtual heritage in this sector is less admired as some authorities considered digital media as a threat for loss of aura, loss of ability to distinguish between real and copy, reduction of knowledge to information and finally loss of institutional authorship. "

p151 authors develop  a 3 step model where step 1 'documentation' involves the tangible & intangible, but as we move to step 2 'representation' constraints and distortion lead to data loss, and then as we move to stage 3 'dissemination' we combine 'media' (hardware, software, narrative) which then the user interacts with. The user is the missing aspect - there is no consideration of 'age, cultural background, ideology, perception, psychology, technical skill, learning ability, cognition' in the design of virtual heritage. This model is drawn from ChanLIn 2001, Osberg 199, Roussou 2008.  This is all to say that there is a 'lack of literature focused on the theory and methodology of user interaction and interpretation of heritage' - designers dump information onto the user.

p 152 - there are no options open for end users to either manipulate or customize the interface or change the predefined way of interpreting the information or even contribute in the reconstruction pro- cess. In this circumstance a viewer faces some degree of lack of association and engagement because: (i) Users feel being imposed, guided and restricted in their individuality and freedom of acquiring knowledge from the content. (ii) As each visitor/user has their own cultural background, so different cultural objects pose different meaning to each person. An artifact that may be very important to one may not be for another user. So the intended interpretation may not occur.

p 152- Tan's suggestions, under 'approaching the problem' -> 'in virtual heritage projects, digitalized artifacts somehow need to trigger the user’s cognitive process while he is exploring the virtual environment,

pg 152 - 'While developing a virtual heritage environment we need to consider two important basic things: (a) Content development: Technology always has some constrains with hard- ware and software; as well as connected to an ‘image of practice’. Media experts like: modelers, animators, programmers may know how to do -pg 153-  something, but may not be aware of the implicit cultural values of a par- ticular artifacts or environment. So, while working as a cultural preserva- tionist, the implemented methods or approaches reflects their own assumptions and may not be appropriate (Kalay 2008). (b) User interpretation: Virtual environment allows more freedom and authority. Freedom in walkthrough and time-travel allows open-ended sequences of expedition. Such freedom on the other hand may become temporally, as well as spatially confused and to some extent result in ‘getting lost’ in some ancient and unknown world. So, effort should be given to contextualize the experience and set the mood for its understanding (Kalay 2008). A virtual environment thus need to become a ‘context’ where multiple and diverse cultural experiences may occur at different levels for different users (from layman to expert) according to their level of interpretation.

pg 153 - 'Copeland (1998, 2004) suggested a ‘constructivist approach’ for interpreta- tion in an archaeological site. It is an approach of interpretation based on ‘learn- ing by doing’ through problem solving. Copeland explained the implication of constructivist approach as the way that individuals are constantly constructing meaning by their own thought, feeling, actions, negotiation and reaction with the world. Thus constructivist interpretation seeks to engage visitors with evi- dence and help them to construct their own meaning'
