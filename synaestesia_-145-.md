synaesthesia

  

gosden p 166 - discusses the linkages between senses citing Ackerman 1990 on synaesthesia. Goes on to say,
  
"We need to understand the sensorium in which we live as this influences the ways in which we approach objects as archaeologists. Of the myriads of possible ways we could experience and evaluate objects, we exercise only a small proportion. The attempt to appreciate the sensory worlds of others, distant in time and place, necessitates an unlearning: that we subject to scrutiny our sensory education, of which the prejudice towards vision is only one part"
