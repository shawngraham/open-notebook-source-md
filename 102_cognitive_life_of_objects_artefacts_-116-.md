'...the cognitive life of a thing can be that of an object \(via
objectification\) or an artefact \(via intentional use and/or modification...
it is amongst these fine distinctions between thing, object, and artefact that
the meaning of the cognitive life of things can be found, that is, as a
process that characterizes and allows for the passage and interaction between
the states of _thingness_Â and _objecthood._
