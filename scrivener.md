So I have scrivener. In the 'research' folder part of its finder, I added my open notebook source folder. I wonder if when I make a new note, it updates in Scrivener. That's the point of this note - to see what happens when I add it.

Nope: no subsequent updates appearing in Scrivener. So I guess just have the notebook ported over to the 'research' folder in scrivener, grab what you need then go.
