This is a simple note I wrote in nvAlt to fit into my open notebook flow using pykwiki. I have no deep knowledge of linked open data, but I wondered how an open notebook could participate in this ecosystem. The key is probably in the 'title' field that pykwiki looks for, and generates the flat url for. I'd need a kind of ontology for my notes, to govern my naming conventions?

or like the nomisma ontology: #hasNote http://shawngraham.github.io/thoughts%20on%20a%20coin.html

Does that mean I'd have to build an rdf file http://nomisma.org/ontology.rdf and persuade folks to use it? Does such a thing exist already? Or if I built it, then people'd use it - and how? Gosh there's a lot about all this stuff that I need to learn...
