This is a simple note I wrote in nvAlt to fit into my open notebook flow using pykwiki. I have no deep knowledge of linked open data, but I wondered how an open notebook could participate in this ecosystem. The key is probably in the 'title' field that pykwiki looks for, and generates the flat url for. I'd need a kind of ontology for my notes, to govern my naming conventions?
