P19:3-19:5

  

+ The classification of auditory representations depends on relationship
between the signification and the idea being represented, or degree of
'semantic connections to the physical events they represent' \(19:3\)



+ 'Auditory icons' - very close relationship between the short sound and the
idea which it represents

+ Authors use the example of a dot-matrix printer sound to connect to
printing, though I wonder how useful that would be today. Thus these
connections are also time-dependent.

  

+ Authors cite research on how long a sound should be in order to be a good
icon: 200 to 600 ms
