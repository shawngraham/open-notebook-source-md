In conjunction with visualization of uncertainty, differences in values of isosurfaces and volumetric data have been mapped to different parameters of musical sound -- pitch (melody), volume, tempo, timbre, harmony and rhythm. Although initial experiments are encouraging, further work is needed to establish scientific value of musical mappings, both by enriching the world of musical sounds created by the system and by evaluating the performance of human users against specific tasks.
