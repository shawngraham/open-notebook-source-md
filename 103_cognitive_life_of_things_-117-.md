'things can be said to have a cognitive life insofar as things are constantly
implicated in networks, or better 'meshworks' of material engagement. More
simply, things have a cognitive life because minds have a material life. Thus,
very often, what we call an 'object' is part of what we call a 'subject'. In
short, things _are_ us or can _become_ us... Things have a cognitive life
because intelligence exists primarily as an enactive relation between and
among people and things, not as a within-intracranial represenation.
