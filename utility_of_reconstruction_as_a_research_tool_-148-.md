Favro and Johanson, conclusion

"A digital laboratory facilitates experimentation by allowing consideration of alternative reconstructions of both human actions and the environments in which they occur. In creating digital reconstructions of events and places, scholars can yoke together disjointed archaeological sites into a holistic environment, united by a common coordinate system. The experimental insertion of ritual events in these environments can restore human activity to the context it once inhabited. Although the topographical picture and the granularity of the reconstructed evidence have changed, the means of reinterpretation is the same. The exploration of a historical event within its context and the reading of the interrelationship among reconstructed digital forms that are tied to more scientifically accurate topography can give rise to new questions and conclusions. The visualization of historical phenomena temporally and topographically prompts, in turn, the reassessment of literary and material evidence. The digital recreations are not post-research presentations, but integral research tools
