bishop p25

  

-touch & vision are confined to surfaces; sound permeates & transgresses surfaces:

  

" If we consider the import of vision to the general sensorium and
metaphorization of knowledge, then the general figurative language of
“insight” runs counter to surface vs. deep understanding of the world. Sound,
it would seem, not vision or touch, would lead us to the more desired deep
understanding of an object or text."
