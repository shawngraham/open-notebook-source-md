+ A 'spearcon' is created by speeding of speech to the point of
unintelligibility but retaining pitch. '\[They are\] acoustic representations
of spoken words

  

+ Research shows they work particularly well for navigating menu structures
\(of the kind normally found in GUI\)

  

+ These are easier to learn than auditory icons / ear cons.
