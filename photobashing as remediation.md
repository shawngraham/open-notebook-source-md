"To conclude (because lunch-break is over)
Photobashing is a technique which (to my knowledge) has not found a huge amount of use in the archaeological processes. Despite this it provides a space where an interesting interplay between the subjective, mechanical and data driven capture elements of archaeological work-flow can be explored in a way which layers and potentially inverts the usual relationship. Whilst in and of itself it does not appear to be a hugely impactful technique the potential for reflexivity and discussion of the relationship between these dichotomies (digital / physical, objective / subjective, real / simulative, art / data capture etc) seems to be an interesting (albeit a potentially rather superficial) one. Plus it can look cool."
