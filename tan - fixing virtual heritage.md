p 152- Tan's suggestions, under 'approaching the problem' -> 'in virtual heritage projects, digitalized artifacts somehow need to trigger the user’s cognitive process while he is exploring the virtual environment,

pg 152 - 'While developing a virtual heritage environment we need to consider two important basic things: (a) Content development: Technology always has some constrains with hard- ware and software; as well as connected to an ‘image of practice’. Media experts like: modelers, animators, programmers may know how to do -pg 153-  something, but may not be aware of the implicit cultural values of a par- ticular artifacts or environment. So, while working as a cultural preserva- tionist, the implemented methods or approaches reflects their own assumptions and may not be appropriate (Kalay 2008). (b) User interpretation: Virtual environment allows more freedom and authority. Freedom in walkthrough and time-travel allows open-ended sequences of expedition. Such freedom on the other hand may become temporally, as well as spatially confused and to some extent result in ‘getting lost’ in some ancient and unknown world. So, effort should be given to contextualize the experience and set the mood for its understanding (Kalay 2008). A virtual environment thus need to become a ‘context’ where multiple and diverse cultural experiences may occur at different levels for different users (from layman to expert) according to their level of interpretation.

pg 153 - 'Copeland (1998, 2004) suggested a ‘constructivist approach’ for interpreta- tion in an archaeological site. It is an approach of interpretation based on ‘learn- ing by doing’ through problem solving. Copeland explained the implication of constructivist approach as the way that individuals are constantly constructing meaning by their own thought, feeling, actions, negotiation and reaction with the world. Thus constructivist interpretation seeks to engage visitors with evi- dence and help them to construct their own meaning'
