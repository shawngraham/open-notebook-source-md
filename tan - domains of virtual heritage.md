> "According to Addison (2000) there are three major domains in virtual heritage:
  - 3D Documentation: everything from site survey to epigraphy 
  - 3D Representation: from historic reconstruction to visualization
  - 3D Dissemination: from immersive networked worlds to ‘in-situ’ augmented reality." - p 146
