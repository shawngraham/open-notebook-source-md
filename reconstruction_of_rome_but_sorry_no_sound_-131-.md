Favro and Johanson

-authors describe a reconstruction of the urban topography of Rome to better understand the sensory experience of roman funeral processions; however they limit to the visual.

"Every sensorial layer requires a method of citation and analysis, and a large measure of scholarly caution. How can it be proved that ancients experienced light in the same way as moderns? How does one add scholarly rigor to the simulation of smell or sound? Various sensorial additions to a simulation can detract if they are included as an afterthought, even if an illustrative one."

... but they describe sounds (music, chants, wailing) as the procession arrives down from the Capitoline, reaching a crescendo when it 'burst into full view"

  they include a re-creation of this sound: [http://www.jstor.org/action/showPopup?citid=citart1&id=audio0&doi=10.1525%2Fjsah.2010.69.1.12](http://www.jstor.org/action/showPopup?citid=citart1&id=audio0&doi=10.1525/jsah.2010.69.1.12)
