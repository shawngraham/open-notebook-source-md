minogue and jones p 317

+ while teachers have used so-called 'manipulatives' for decades, there is little concrete research on whether or not this actually helps

p317-8

+ does touch make learning more meaningful? does it 'exploit experiential, embodied, and tactile knowledge that might not otherwise be called upon? Does the unique bi-directional exchange of information between a user and a haptic device \(simulating the sense of touch\) somehow enhance the learning experience?"

SG - contrast with Gosden on sensorium, re bi-directional exchange and agency of objects

SG - also the piece on helicopter symphony, where 'hearing' is directly equated with touch \(difference being touch is active, whereas hearing is _touched by_ )
